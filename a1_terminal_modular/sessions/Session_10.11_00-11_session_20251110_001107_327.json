Makes me feel like ridin' off into the wild blue yonder, don't it?\n\nSay, have you got any plans for today? Maybe we could ride over to the next town and see if there's any trouble brewin'. Or maybe we could just take a nice, leisurely stroll through these here hills and enjoy the peace and quiet. Whaddaya say, partner? You up fer some fun?"
